# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about how I ended up taking this course. 

I was following [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com), 
There was a chapter about Pseudocode linking to [Viking Code School](vikingcodeschool.com)
This article was part of a course about _Enineering_
I found out that this was the more advanced in a 3-course series
Since I liked it, I decided to go with the first course _Developer_,
There was a chapter on __Git__
That article linked to [Resources to learn Git](http://try.github.io/)
From there I decided to follow paths from easiest, 
Now I'm here
